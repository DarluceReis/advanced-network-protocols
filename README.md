# üåê Network Configuration Project

This repository contains the configuration files and a detailed explanation of the **network topology** I designed and implemented in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
The project uses the following network configuration techniques:

- **VLSM subnetting**
- **Dynamic routing** (RIP)
- **Redundancy protocols** (HSRP)
- **Advanced security features**

---

## Project Overview

The network is composed of **three main sites**:

1. **Production Site = Vila Real**  
2. **Central Office = Porto**  
3. **Datacenter = Lisbon**  

The goal was to establish robust, secure, and redundant communication between all locations.

## 1. Production Site ‚Äî Vila Real

 **Subnets configured with VLSM** starting from 183.16.0.0/16 to optimize address space usage:

| Subnet         | Supported Hosts | 
|----------------|-----------------|
| **VILAREAL 1** | 1024            | 
| **VILAREAL 2** | 800             |

**DHCP Service**  
A dedicated DHCP server (**Server-PT Server1**) was configured to dynamically assign IP addresses to all hosts in Vila Real.

## 2. Datacenter ‚Äî Lisbon

A key location, hosting the **central DNS server** for the entire network.

- **DNS Server:** Server-PT DNS SERVER
- **IP Address:** Static
- **Domain Name:** cesae.local
- **Function:** Resolves hostnames for all network devices.

## 3. Central Office ‚Äî Porto

### VLANs & VTP
- **VLAN 10 ‚Äî FINANCEIRO:** 192.168.10.0/25  
- **VLAN 20 ‚Äî STAFF:** 192.168.20.0/26  
- **VTP (Virtual Trunking Protocol)** configured for automatic VLAN management.

### HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
- **HSRP-ACTIVE** router acts as the primary gateway.
- **HSRP-STANDBY** router remains ready to take over in case of failure.

### Inter-VLAN Routing
- Implemented using the **Router-on-a-Stick** method for VLAN communication.

---

## 4. Routing

- **Protocol Used:** RIP (Routing Information Protocol) for dynamic routing between the three sites.

---

## 5. Security & Hardening

- **Port-Security:**  
  - **VLAN 10 (Financeiro):** Shutdown mode, 1 dynamic MAC per port.  
  - **VLAN 20 (Staff):** Restrict mode, 1 static MAC per port.  

- **DHCP Snooping:**  Prevents rogue DHCP server attacks by filtering DHCP messages from untrusted sources. 
A rate limit of 100 packets per second was set on all ports, with a specific port configured to a limit of 1 packet per second for testing purposes.  
- **ARP Inspection:** Protects against ARP spoofing attacks.  
- **STP Hardening:** PortFast and BPDU Guard on all access ports to ensure network stability and prevent unwanted topology changes.
